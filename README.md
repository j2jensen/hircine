Hircine
=======

Hircine is a stand-alone [RavenDB](http://ravendb.net/) index builder used in CI systems and automated deployments. Think of it like FluentMigrations, but for RavenDB indexes instead of SQL schemas.

The creators of Hircine no longer support it, but I needed to be able to run it against a newer version of RavenDb, so this fork tracks these changes. Please check out the [original project](https://github.com/markedup-mobi/hircine) and [its wiki](https://github.com/markedup-mobi/hircine/wiki) for usage instructions.
